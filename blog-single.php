			<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#6 Two Metre Social Distancing</h2>
			<p>The WHO organization has announced this week that starting from 25 Julu , the two metre recommendation would be reduced to ‘one metre plus’ across all country. This means staying one metre apart, plus mitigations that reduce the risk of transmission. Singapore’s PM will announce a review of the two metre guideline by 27 July. The advice in Wales remains two metres. Malaysia moves to one metre on Monday. </p>
			<img src="images/image_12.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
			<p>Commenting on the one metre guidance, an operator told LTT it might allow an extra one or two people on a double decker. “But you’re not going to get to 50 per cent capacity on the back of this.”
			Operators do not expect the Government to provide detailed guidance on the one metre distancing. “The Government does not seem interested in giving clear advice, which is understandable because it’s difficult,” said the operator.
			Public Health Scotland has been looking at the idea of installing screens on the back of bus seats to divide passengers, as a way of allowing one passenger to sit in each set of double seats. </p>
			
			<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#7 Billion Stars' New Plan</h2>
			<p>According to the senior manager from Billion Stars. It is rumored that Billion Stars will be pushing out more plans to their customers. This news was later confirmed by the CEO of Billion Stars and they'll be renewing and also
			pushing out more new plans to allow their customers to choose from. The new plans will be available from 22/7 onwards.</p>
			<img src="images/image_13.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
			<p>Fast urbanization generates increasing amounts of travel flows, urging the need for efficient transport planning policies. In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport 
			modes using mobile network data. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm</p>
			
			<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#8 The Hero - Bus Workers</h2>
			<p>“When you’re in this profession, you’re a family,” the Unite union regional officer says today. “When someone loses their life, it hurts. The government keeps saying this pandemic is a war – well, we were being killed.”</p>
			<img src="images/image_14.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
			<p>In many ways, they have found themselves on something approximate to a front line. “But you carry on because, what’s drummed into you, is that it’s you who keeps the country moving,” says Murphy, a driver in London of 25 years before he took up his current post with Unite. “Whatever happens – terror attack, disaster, pandemic – it’s your duty to carry on.”
			Such workers have done all this, it’s worth adding, despite measures to protect their safety often being slow and limited. More of which shortly.For now, none of this has gone unnoticed by many of us</p>
